Calculate SMS GSM 03.38 message encoding and length, and number of concatenated SMS required

## Installation

```sh
composer require phlib/sms-length
```

## Usage

Simple string which fits within GSM 03.38 7-bit alphabet:

```php
$smsLength = new \Phlib\SmsLength\SmsLength('simple message');
$smsLength->validate(); // Throw exceptions for any validation failures
$smsLength->getSize(); // 14
$smsLength->getEncoding(); // '7-bit'
$smsLength->getMessageCount(); // 1
$smsLength->getUpperBreakpoint(); // 160
```

Message which contains characters forcing switch to using GSM 03.38 UCS-2:

```php
$smsLength = new \Phlib\SmsLength\SmsLength('message with â€¢ char requiring UCS-2');
$smsLength->validate(); // Throw exceptions for any validation failures
$smsLength->getSize(); // 35
$smsLength->getEncoding(); // 'ucs-2'
$smsLength->getMessageCount(); // 1
$smsLength->getUpperBreakpoint(); // 70
```

## Background

In the course of adding an SMS module to our Commercial software, we have found
need for the SMS length properties which we've included in this package.

Our third-party SMS gateway provider's API will of course error if the message
length exceeds the maximum allowed, and handles the correct concatenation and
encoding for the given UTF-8 string.

However we want to be able to inform our users of message size and limits while
they're building their SMS campaign (in advance of a live send). Plus we also
need to show how many concatenated SMS they will use per contact, and therefore
indicate pricing.

The unit tests and inspections made by this package are based on
[GSM 03.38 / 3GPP 23.038](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38) for encoding
and [GSM 03.40 / 3GPP 23.040](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.40) for
[concatenated SMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenated_SMS). We have also
referred to documentation provided by third-party SMS gateway providers such as
[MessageBird](https://support.messagebird.com/hc/en-us/articles/208739745-How-long-can-a-text-message-be-)
and [Messente](https://messente.com/documentation/tools/sms-length-calculator).
